1. Clone the repo

2. Init Kubebuilder
  kubebuilder init --domain nishant.ingle --repo github.com/Nishant-Ingle/apple-operator


3. Define a custom resource
  kubebuilder create api --group apple --version v1 --kind ContainerInjector

4. Every struct should have json tags at all levels

5. Run make build

6. Complete the Reconcile method 

7. Run make build

8. Run: make run

   There is no CRD and apple.dev group so this should fail

9. Run: make install

   This installs the operator in k8s cluster

10. Now make run should work

11. Create CR using config/samples/example.yaml with image busybox

12. Apply the manifest, nothing gets logged as there is no deployment yet.

13. Create nginx deployment and install it

    We see 4 logs, deployment got updated 4 times e.g. status updates

    Updating own resource makes reconcile again -> infinite loop

14. What label are we looking for ?
    Add a label to spec.
    Add label: "injector:help" to CR spec.
    Add label: injector: help to nginx deploy

15. Create clean nginx manifest

16. Add busybox container dynamically

17. Finalizer restores state before CR was present, here busybox container would be gone.
